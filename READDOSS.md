## Dashboard Process

 - Data Loading and Preparation 
   The data was imported from CSV files provided by Maven Analytics into Excel.
   Data cleaning and formatting were done within Excel using features like Power Query and built-in formulas to ensure consistency in dates, categories, and locations.

 - Metric Calculations
   Excel formulas and functions were used to calculate key metrics such as total revenue, average unit price, and growth rates. Named ranges and dynamic formulas enhanced the dashboard’s flexibility.

 - Visualization and Layout Design
   Excel charts (e.g., line charts, bar graphs, slicers, and pivot tables) were used to design an interactive and user-friendly interface. Filters and slicers allowed users to drill down by category, location, and segment.
   Hyperlinks were incorporated to allow the use of "buttons" to easily navigate the different sheets

-  Dashboard Testing and Refinement
   The dashboard was reviewed for accuracy, interactivity, and performance.
